# 3D-Audio-Maker
In this project we can make a normal audio to a 3D one. You should listen to the output of the code with headset to sense the changes. This project is written in Matlab. 

Becareful to load your own file and change the time sections of the code to make your audio 3D better. Hope you enjoy ;)
